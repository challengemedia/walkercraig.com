title: Sleep Now, Child

<br/>

Sleep now, Child

Adore the feeling

A long day gone

The Soul needs healing

Be still your heart

And keep believing

The dreams you dream

Is your mind receiving

Creation's gift

Of pioneering

Press through the dark

The unknown fearing

Ever hunting

For the clearing

Where the Light reigns

And grants us our best seeing

Where Wisdom basks

And seeds our freeing

Outcome testing

Void of pleading

The best path forward

In search of meaning

The only lesson

Worth the bleeding

<br/>

Sleep now, Child

Adore the feeling

A long day gone

The Soul needs healing

Receive the Grace

And let Life leaven

Embrace your gift

And glimpse of HÃ¦ven

<br/>
