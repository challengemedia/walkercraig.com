    <p><h3>Evangelines</h3></p>
    <p>The Evangelines are a small group of practitioners of what can best be described as both a religious philosophy and a philosophy of religion. A metareligion and a metaphilosophy. Some call it a syncretism while others call it a return to the foundation of spirituality. It is ancient and it is modern. It may be the first of its kind, and it is perhaps the last of its kind. Do not be afraid.</p>
